# Entynet Remete Administration Tool (entypreter)

    INFO: The Entynet Remote Administration Tool (entypreter) 
    is a Windows post-exploitation rootkit similar to other penetration 
    testing tools such as Meterpreter and Powershell Invader Framework. 
    The major difference is that entypreter does most of its operations 
    using Windows Script Host (a.k.a. JScript/VBScript), with compatibility 
    in the core to support a default installation of Windows 2000 with no service 
    packs (and potentially even versions of NT4) all the way through Windows 10.
    
# Thats all!
